# Task-5-Data-Cleaning
# Objective
The objective of this task is to perform basic data cleaning using Python and Pandas.
This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting datatypes,
and creating new features for better analysis.

# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

# Dataset
- Titanic Dataset

# Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Inspected data structure and missing values.
3. Handled missing values:
   - Filled numerical columns using median.
   - Filled categorical columns using mode.
   - Dropped irrelevant columns with excessive missing data.
4. Removed duplicate records.
5. Converted appropriate columns to categorical datatypes.
6. Created new features such as Age Category and Fare Band.
7. Saved the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

# Files Included
- `Task5_Cleaning.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with code and explanations
- `cleaned_data.csv` – Cleaned output dataset
- `titanic.csv` – Original dataset

# Outcome
This task demonstrates how Python and Pandas can efficiently replace
manual data cleaning processes in Excel, especially for large datasets.
